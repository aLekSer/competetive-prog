# competetive-programming

A place where all progress on competitions would be collected and pushed after the end of competitions and results would be sounded.

The playgrounds where I registered and successfully participated:
* hackerrank.com
* codechef.com
* topcoder.com
* bubblecup.org


coursera.org also very useful to train in any Algorithm courses for example I finished Tim Hougarden Stanford course.
